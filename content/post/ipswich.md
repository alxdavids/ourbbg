Today, Steve McClaren was confirmed as the new technical director of
Derby County. His association with the club goes all the way back to
1985: this will be his fifth time arriving at Derby in an official
capacity. The incoming takeover rumbles on in the background amidst
silence from the outgoing administration. Derby County sit bottom of the
championship; manager-less and goal-less.

It seems only fitting that in this article we will return to the moment
that Steve McClaren was appointed Head Coach of Derby County for the
first time, in September 2013. This first spell at the club brought a
sustained period of improved performance and results that had not been
seen at the club many years prior. An improvement on the George Burley
years by means of establishing a more consistent approach to winning
football matches. A step above the Billy Davies era (if ultimately less
successful) by routinely outplaying all manners of opposition.

In truth, McClaren's managerial reign went on to define a philosophy and
set of players whose shadows the club has never truly escaped from. A
period of such success (relative to previous years) whilst working with
little resources should really have been transformed into some tangible
reward. Instead, the weight of expectation that these years generated
became the albatross around the club's neck. Derby were probably the
best team in the championship by some way for a 16 month period.
Unfortunately that 16 month period bridged two separate seasons, neither
of which ended in promotion. The club has never really recovered.

There are many things that can be said about this period but, in the
interest of keeping the word count down, we will focus on the match that
started it all. A game watched by 21,000 people on a cold night in
October against Ipswich Town, managed by Mick McCarthy. Where the core
principles and ideas of the renowned 4-3-3 formation crystallised. The
tactical setup that would become the baseline by which the future
strategic incarnations would be judged against. In addition, it would
bring together a group of players that Derby (and myself) would never
really move on from.

## The sacking of Nigel Clough

Nigel Clough and the years he spent as the manager of Derby County
probably deserve their own dedicated discussions, but his ending came as
something of a surprise. After 9 games, in a very typical Nigel Clough
start to the season, Derby lay 14th on 11 points. It was a shock to see
Clough shown the door after the best of four years of very similar
showings, but the lack of improvement -- coupled with a routine defeat
away at Forest -- seemed to indicate that progress was going to be
limited in the upcoming season, as well.

In the last season, Derby had finished 10th. With 7 games to play there
was a  still marginal hope that they may make the playoffs.
Unfortunately, a poor run of results saw Derby fall a significant number
of points off. In the close season, they had decided to sign loanees
Chris Martin and Craig Forsyth permanently, whilst also striking a very
Nigel Clough deal to sign the Scottish forward Johnny Russell from
Dundee United. Other deals included signing long-term transfer target
John Eustace, and the goalkeeper Lee Grant (both for the second time).

The start of the new season saw the team struggle at home: beaten
comprehensively by the eventual top two Leicester and Burnley, and yet
to win at Pride Park by the time Ipswich arrived. Away from home was a
different story, where Derby had three wins -- scoring three and five
goals at Yeovil and Millwall, respectively -- remaining unbeaten until
Clough's final match. The energetic midfielder Craig Bryson had
demonstrated his rising goal threat with a hattrick in the Millwall
game. A troubling start no doubt, but not without reasons for some
optimism.

Steve McClaren was announced as Head Coach the day before the Ipswich
game, arriving with Paul Simpson as assistant, "it's great to be back
here" he said in his first interview. (Little did he know...). Derby
independently announced the signing of Zak Whitbread on loan from
Leicester (a strangely Nigel Clough signing itself) to further push the
notion that the title "Head Coach" was not a misnomer.

## A disastrous start

Sitting in the ground with my Dad, I was full of optimism for a new
start that was seemingly not matched by the rest of the city, judging by
the attendance anyway. The Clough era never really worked for me, and so
(even) Steve McClaren was a breath of fresh air. But, for this game, it
was Darren Wassall in charge (the head of the youth team). McClaren was
in the stadium having not signed in time to have the honour of leading
the team out yet.

With everything that has come and gone since, the initial set up looks a
bit laughable now. A midfield two of Bryson and Hughes was always going
to be far too open; any fool with retrospective vision could have told
you that! Not to mention the fact that Conor Sammon and Ben Davies
should never have been on the pitch in the first place. Chris Martin in
a front two? Please.

However, it was only the currency of set pieces that the opening half of
this game would accept as legal tender. Ipswich took a 2-0 lead from two
terribly defended corners. Current mid-priced FPL defensive shout Aaron
Cresswell delivering with two assists.

Now, Derby scored from their own corner. Ben Davies supplying the corner
and Zak Whitbread heading in to kickstart Derby's fightback. But the
resurgence was immediately dampened, Cresswell now firing his own shot
straight through Lee Grant. He then retrieved his third assist with
*another* corner, headed in for a second time by Daryl Murphy. Imagine
the points haul for a performance like that!

## A comeback

Half time in the stands was the same as usual: standing around, waiting
for the team to finish off their horrible nights work and let us get
home. In the dressing room, it turns out, McClaren and Simpson had
decided that the first half performance was beyond the pale and their
lack of contractual obligations was not going to stop them. Demanding a
switch to a 4-3-3 that would allow the midfield of Hughes and Bryson
more license to attack with a defensive shield in behind was the first
change; John Eustace coming on for Conor Sammon. The removal of the
systematically poor Ben Davies for some more mobility on the wing in
Mason Bennett was the second. Overall, these were potentially negative
changes, but the foresight to coordinate the attack from the midfield
was to change the game (and the subsequent seasons). A rousing team talk
was reportedly given by Paul Simpson and away they went.

On the pitch, Derby started the second half like a team that were
grappling with their last chance to save a season that was fast
unravelling into mediocrity. There were midfield runners: Craig Bryson
arrived into the box to reduce the deficit after only two minutes. The
wide players were feeding off the cultured three-course meals served up
by Chris Martin: Jamie Ward brought Derby closer to a highly improbable
equaliser in the middle of the half. Craig Bryson, a man desperate to
assert his credentials for his second player of the season award even at
this early stage, completed the comeback as Derby fashioned attacks from
multiple angles to grind Ipswich into a pulp.

I always found it a little strange that Craig Bryson celebrated the
final goal rather than sprinting the ball back to the centre circle,
such was the level of dominance. It seemed inevitable that the team
would win from the very first minute of the half, so it was a minor
disappointment to only manage to overcome the mere three goal deficit
for the draw.

## A catalyst

I left Pride Park that night thinking that something dramatic had
changed, but not being quite able to put my finger on it. The talk the
next day was of the immediate reaction that the manager had had in his
half-time team talk. It was obvious that the 4-3-3 formation that
finished the game would continue into the next, with the substitutes
Eustace and Bennett probably likely to start again at the weekend.

Up next was Leeds at home, and what came was a 3-1 win. Ten wins, two
draws, and one loss from the next thirteen matches. Rising to third
place after a win at Barnsley in the last game of 2013. The second half
of the season would be bumpier, but they would still finish the season
an improbably 3rd. Losing only to Queens Park Rangers in one of the
greatest injustices that a play-off final has witnessed.

While small adjustments were made to the personnel over that season, the
formation and style of play stuck. In fact, it was only when Gary Rowett
succeeded McClaren (part two) in 2017 that the formation was really
abandoned. When McClaren was sacked at the end of the 2015 season, it
was noted that Derby didn't have a plan B when things got tough. But the
real issue seemed to be that they had lost the personnel to play the
required roles.

## What remains?

The only player left from that Tuesday night against Ipswich is Craig
Forsyth, but it would be surprising if he remained a Derby player beyond
this season. Beyond the long-serving left back, it's difficult to see
what remains from the night. A match of such symbolic importance that it
kicked the club into its most positive period of football since the late
90s.

Now, the club sits bottom of the championship, led by an interim
management team centred around Wayne Rooney. It's easy to wonder whether
the club has finally expelled all of the optimism and impetus generated
on that extraordinary night.
