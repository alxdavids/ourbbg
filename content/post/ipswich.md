Today Steve McClaren was confirmed as the new technical director of
Derby County. His association with the club goes all the way back to
1985: this will be his fifth time arriving at Derby in some official
capacity. The incoming takeover rumbles on in the background amidst
silence from the outgoing administration. Derby County sit bottom of the
championship; manager-less and goal-less.

It seems only fitting that in this article we will return to the moment
that Steve McClaren was appointed Head Coach of Derby County for the
first time, in September 2013. This first spell at the club brought a
sustained period of improved performance and results that had not been
seen at the club many years prior. An improvement on the George Burley
years by means of establishing a more consistent approach to winning
football matches. A step above the Billy Davies era (if ultimately less
successful) by routinely outplaying the opposition.

In truth, his managerial reign went on to define a philosophy and a set
of players whose shadows the club has never truly escaped from. A period
of such success (relative to previous years) on relatively little
resources should have been capitalised on. Instead the weight of
expectation that these years generated became the albatross around the
club's neck. Derby were probably the best team in the championship by
some way for a 16 month period. Unfortunately that 16 month period
bridged two separate seasons, neither of which ended in promotion. The
club has never really recovered.

There are many things that can be said about this period but, in the
interest of keeping the word count down, we will focus on the match that
started it all. A game watched by 21000 people on a cold night in
October against Ipswich Town, managed by Mick McCarthy. Where the core
principles and ideas of the 4-3-3 formation that would become the
baseline by which the future incarnations of the club's tactical setup
would be judged against. Bringing together a group of players that Derby
would never really move on from.

## The sacking of Nigel Clough

Nigel Clough and the years he spent as the manager of Derby County
probably deserve their own dedicated discussions, but his ending came as
something of a surprise. After 9 games, in a very typical Nigel Clough
start to the season, Derby lay 14th on 11 points. It was a shock to see
Clough shown the door after the best of four years of very similar
showings, but the lack of improvement coupled with a routine defeat away
at Forest seemed to indicate that progress was going to be limited in
the upcoming season as well.

In the last season, Derby had finished 10th. With 7 games to play there
was a marginal hope that they may make the playoffs but a poor run of
results saw Derby fall a significant number of points off. In the close
season, they had decided to sign Chris Martin and Craig Forsyth
permanently, whilst also striking a very Nigel Clough deal to sign the
Scottish forward Johnny Russell from Dundee United. Other deals included
signing long-term transfer target John Eustace, and the goalkeeper Lee
Grant (both for the second time).

This time around the team struggled at home, beaten comprehensively by
the eventual top two Leicester and Burnley, and yet to win at Pride Park
by the time Ipswich arrived. Away from home was a different story, where
they had three wins (including three and five goals at Yeovil and
Millwall, respectively) and were unbeaten until they lost to Forest at
the end of September. The ever energetic midfielder Craig Bryson had
demonstrated his rising goal threat with a hattrick in the Millwall
game. A troubling start no doubt, but not without reasons for some
optimism.

Steve McClaren was announced as Head Coach the day before the Ipswich
game, arriving with Paul Simpson as assistant, "it's great to be back
here" he said in his first interview. Little did he know... Derby also
announced the signing of Zak Whitbread on loan from Leicester (a
strangely Nigel Clough signing itself) to further push the notion that
the title "Head Coach" was not a misnomer.

## A disastrous start

Sitting in the ground with my Dad, I was full of optimism for a new
start that was seemingly not matched by the rest of the city. The Nigel
Clough era never really worked for me, and so (even) Steve McClaren was
a breath of fresh air. But for this game, it was Darren Wassall in
charge (the head of the youth team). McClaren was in the stadium but
hadn't signed the contract in time to have the honour of leading the
team out yet.

With everything that has come and gone since, the initial set up looks a
bit laughable now. A midfield two of Bryson and Hughes was always going
to be far too open; any fool with retrospective vision could have told
you that! Not to mention the fact that Conor Sammon and Ben Davies
should never have been on the pitch in the first place. Chris Martin in
a front two? Please.

But it was only the currency of set pieces that the opening half of the
game would accept as legal tender. Ipswich took a 2-0 lead from two
terribly defended corners. Future mid-priced FPL shout Aaron Cresswell
delivering with two assists.

Now, Derby scored from their own corner. Ben Davies supplying the corner
and Zak Whitbread heading in to kickstart Derby's fightback. But the
resurgence was immediately dampened, Cresswell now firing his own shot
straight through Lee Grant. He then retrieved his third assist with
*another* corner, headed in for a second time by Daryl Murphy.

## A comeback

Half time in the stands was the same as usual. Standing around waiting
for the team to come out and finish off what they had started. In the
dressing room, McClaren and Simpson had decided that the first half
performance was beyond the pale. Demanding a switch to a 4-3-3 that
would allow the midfield of Hughes and Bryson more license to attack
with a defensive shield in behind, and the removal of the systematically
poor Ben Davies for some more mobility on the wing. On came John Eustace
for Conor Sammon, and Mason Bennett for Davies. On the face of it,
potentially negative changes, but the foresight to coordinate the attack
from the midfield was to change the game (and the subsequent seasons). A
rousing team talk was reportedly given by Paul Simpson and away they
went.

On the pitch, Derby started the second half like a team that were
grappling with their last chance to save a season that was fast
unravelling into mediocrity. There were midfield runners: Craig Bryson
arriving into the box to reduce the deficit after only two minutes. The
wide players were feeding off the cultured three-course meals served up
by Chris Martin: Jamie Ward bringing Derby closer to a highly improbable
equaliser. Craig Bryson, a man desperate to assert his credentials for
his second player of the season award even at this early stage,
completed the comeback as Derby fashioned attacks from multiple angles
to grind Ipswich into a pulp.

I always found it a little strange that Craig Bryson celebrated the
final goal rather than sprinting the ball back to the centre circle,
such was the level of dominance. It seemed inevitable that the team
would win from the very first minute of the half, so it was a minor
disappointment to only manage to overcome the mere three goal deficit
for the draw.

## A catalyst

I left Pride Park that night thinking that something dramatic had
changed, but not being quite able to put my finger on it. The talk the
next day was of the immediate reaction that the manager had had in his
half-time team talk. It was obvious that the 4-3-3 formation that
finished the game would continue into the next, with the substitutes
Eustace and Bennett probably likely to start again at the weekend.

Up next was Leeds at home, and what came was a 3-1 win. Ten wins, two
draws, and one loss from the next thirteen matches. Rising to third
place after a win in the last game of 2013. The second half of the
season would be bumpier, but they would still finish the season an
improbably 3rd. Losing only to Queens Park Rangers in one of the biggest
injustices a play-off final has seen.

While small adjustments were made to the personnel over that season, the
formation and style of play stuck. In fact, it was only when Gary Rowett
succeeded McClaren (part two) in 2017 that the formation was really
abandoned. When McClaren was sacked at the end of the 2015 season, it
was noted that Derby didn't have a plan B when things got tough. But the
real issue seemed to be that they had lost the personnel to play the
required roles.

## What remains?

The only player left from that Tuesday night against Ipswich is Craig
Forsyth, but it would be surprising if he remained a Derby player beyond
this season. Beyond the long-serving left back, it's difficult to see
what remains from the night that kicked the club into its most positive
period of football since the late 90s.

Now, sitting bottom of the championship, led by an interim management
team centred around Wayne Rooney. It's easy to wonder how it all went so
wrong.
