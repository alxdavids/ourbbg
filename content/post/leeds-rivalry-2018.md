In a duo of podcasts we chart the recent history of the rivalry between Derby County and Leeds United. In particular we focus on the period between 2018 and 2020, when Derby and Leeds vied for promotion to the Premier League, with clashing team-building strategies and some memorable encounters on football (and training) pitches.

With a number of guests and discussions that range across many different talking points, I will leave this week's analysis to the podcasts themselves.
