In a duo of podcasts we chart the recent history of the rivalry between Derby County and Leeds United. In particular we focus on the 2018-2019 season, when Derby and Leeds vied for promotion to the Premier League, with clashing team-building strategies and some memorable encounters on football (and training) pitches.

With a number of guests and discussions that range across many different talking points, I will leave this week's analysis to the podcasts themselves.
