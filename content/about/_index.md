Our Baseball Ground charts the memories and experiences of Alex and
Alex: a married couple who recently moved to Lisbon, Portugal. They have
watched Derby County for far longer than is necessary, having had season
tickets from the early 2000s until 2020. At the age of 28, their
memories of Derby County span close to two decades of (*almost
entirely*) second-tier English football.

Over a series of articles and podcasts published every two weeks, Our
Baseball Ground focuses solely on Derby County's history since being
relegated from the Premier League in 2002. The central theme of this
exploration considers crucial matches, moments, people, and objects
associated with the football club; primarily considering their impact on
and association with what has ultimately been a period of slow and
torturous decline.
