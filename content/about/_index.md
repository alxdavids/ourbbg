Our Baseball Ground charts the memories and experiences of Alex and
Alex: a married couple, recently moved to Lisbon, Portugal, who have
watched Derby County for far longer than is necessary. Having had season
tickets from the early 2000s until 2020, their memories of Derby County
span close to two decades of (*almost entirely*) second-tier English
football.

Over a series of articles and podcasts, Our Baseball Ground focuses
solely on Derby County's history since being relegated from the Premier
League in 2002. The central theme of this exploration considers crucial
matches, moments, people, and objects associated with the football
club; primarily considering their impact on and association with what
has ultimately been a period of slow and torturous decline.

We aim to publish one article and podcast each week that discusses a
single point of reference, and how it fits into this broader narrative.
